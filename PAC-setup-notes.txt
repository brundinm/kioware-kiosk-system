There are four principal steps to setting up a new computer as a public
access computer (PAC):

     * Install KioWare
     * Add users to the Administrator Group (these are users with PAC
       maintenance responsibilities)
     * Enable remote access
     * Enable concurrent connections

(1) To install KioWare kiosk software
* Log into the workstation using own MacEwan University network account
and password
* Create a new local user account called "publicaccess"
- Type "user accounts" and hit Enter
- In the "Other users" section, click the "+" sign for "Add someone else
to this PC"
- Click on "I don't have this person's sign-in information"
- Click on "Add a user without a Microsoft account"
- In the "User name" textbox, make the username "publicaccess"
- For the password for the public access account, make it "puBl1kacce55F3"
("el" followed by "one")
- Click "Next"
- Sign out of your network account on the PAC, and log in with the new
local publicaccess account
- Sign out of the local publicaccess account, and log back in with your
network account
* Add new entries to the Windows registry to enable automatic logging into the
newly created account called "publicaccess"
- Navigate to the following Windows registry key:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
Winlogon
- In the Winlogon key, create a new String Value; rename this new string
"DefaultUserName"
- Double click on DefaultUserName and give it a "Value data" entry of
"ad\publicaccess"
- In the Winlogon key, create a new String Value; rename this new string
"DefaultPassword"
- Double click on DefaultPassword and give it a "Value data" entry of
"puBl1kacce55F3" ("el" followed by "one")
* Install the KioWare software application
- Double click on KioWareClientSetup.exe executable file
- Step through the dialog screens to finish installing KioWare; don't need to
worry about configuration settings, as these will all be contained in the
KioWare config file ("KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig") that you will copy
over next
* Copy over the master copies of the "ConfigToolSettings.json" and
"KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig"
- Copy over the files "ConfigToolSettings.json" and
"KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig" that contain all of the KioWare settings
to the new installation and replace the existing files on the PAC -- the path
to copy the files is the following:
C:\ProgramData\KioWare Client\KioWare
- Copy over and replace these two files -- the other two files,
"MachineConfig.json" and "sqlite3.dll" can be left as is
("MachineConfig.json" will contain the licensing information when you add
it later)
* Copy over and  replace the UserData directory on the PAC with the master
copy of the UserData directory
- Copy the master copy of "UserData" to the PAC -- the path to copy the
UserData directory is the following:
C:\ProgramData\KioWare Client 
(this directory contains various KioWare customizations, including custom
toolbar images, and custom toolbar JavaScript code)
* Add licensing information
- Launch "Kioware Config Tool"
- Click on "License" tab, and add the "Transaction Number" and the
"Authorization Code", which are provided on the KioWare "License Certificate"
PDF document
- Click on the "Get Electronic License" button, which will autopopulate the
rest of the licensing information
* Enable automatic Windows log in, and make KioWare the shell rather than
explorer.exe
- Launch "KioWare Config Tool"
- Click on "System Settings" tab
- In the "Windows AutoLogon Settings" section, click the slider to "ON"
- Again in the Windows AutoLogon Settings section, in the Username and
Password boxes add "ad\publicaccess" as the username and provide the
publicaccess account's password "puBl1kacce55F3" ("el" followed by "one");
click the "Test AutoLogon" button to see if the credentials are correct
- In the "Utility to Change User Settings (including their Shell)" pane,
provide the username, which is "ad.macewan.ca\publicaccess", and provide
the "publicaccess" account's password, "puBl1kacce55F3" ("el" followed by
"one")
- In the next dialog box, select the second radio button option to make
KioWare the shell process
- Reboot the workstation; workstation will automatically log into the
"publicaccess" acount, and automatically launch KioWare as the default
shell process

(2) To add a user to the Administrator Group
* Log out of KioWare kiosk mode, and then log in with your network account
- Key combination to get exit action code dialog box: Alt-F4
- Exit action code password to exit KioWare: 1971
- Log in with your own network username and password
* Run ==> compmgmt.msc
* From the Computer Management screen that opens, go to
Local Users and Groups ==> Groups ==> Administrators
* Then click the Add button
- The users with Administrator Group privileges are ad\brundinm,
and ad\mccreadys

(3) To enable remote access
- Type remote in the search box
- Select "Allow remote access to your computer"
- On the Remote tab, in the "Remote Desktop" pane, ensure that "Allow
remote connections to this computer" is selected
- Click on the "Select Users..." button, then click on the "Add" button
to add users who can remotely access the public access workstation
- The users with remote access privileges are ad\brundinm, and
ad\mccreadys

(4) To enable concurrent connections
* There used to be two ways to enable concurrent connections: modifying
the termsrv.dll file, or installing RDP Wrapper.  The use of Sophos
Endpoint antivirus software means that we can no longer install RDP
Wrapper (Sophos deletes files during installation which prevents the
installation of RDP Wrapper).  Note: the two downstairs PACs are using
RDP Wrapper to enable concurrent connections, and the two upstairs PACs
are using modified termsrv.dll files to enable concurrent connections.

* To modify the termsrv.dll file
- termsrv.dll is located in C:\Windows\System32
- Make copy of termsrv.dll file in the System32 directory called
termsrv.dll.orig.bak
- Copy PAC termsrv.dll to your own computer, where you will have full
rights to the file
- Use HxD hex editor to search and replace a string pattern
search: 39 81 3C 06 00 00 0F 84 3B 2B 01 00
replace: B8 00 01 00 00 89 81 38 06 00 00 90
Make sure in "Search -> Replace" that you click on Hex-values tab before
you search and replace 
Note: the latest (Windows 10 Version 1709 [OS Build 16299.1150])
termsrv.dll file version is 10.0.17763.437
- Save modified termsrv.dll file
- Make copy of modified termsrv.dll called termsrv.dll.rev.bak and copy
it into the PAC's System32 directory
- Stop Terminal Service:
net stop termservice
- To take ownership of the original PAC termsrv.dll file, and then
give yourself full control, do the following:
- To first take ownership of the file, do the following:
- Right click on termsrv.dll and select Properties -> Security tab
- Click Advanced button
- Click "Change" link
- Click Advanced button
- Provide your name in the text area pane, e.g., "brundinm"
- Click OK, and then click OK again; need to completely exit from all
dialog boxes to have ownership of the file
- To next grant full access control over the file to your account, do
the following:
- Right click on termsrv.dll and select Properties -> Security tab
- Click Advanced button
- Under the Permissions tab, click the Add button
- Click on the "Select a principal" link
- Provide your name in the text area pane, e.g., "brundinm"
- Click OK
- In the Permission Entry dialog box in the "Basic permissions:" pane,
select the "Full control" checkbox
- Click OK, and then click Apply
- Click OK, and then click OK again
- Copy modified termsrv.dll file from your computer or flash drive to
overwrite and replace the PAC termsrv.dll file
- Start Terminal Service:
net start termservice
- Reboot computer

* To install RDP Wrapper (RDPWrap)
- Unzip the ZIP file archive of RDPWrap
- Launch CMD as an Administrator
- Navigate to the unzipped RDPWrap directory
- Type "install"
- Check that it has been installed correctly by using File Explorer to
double-click on RDPConf.exe
- Move the RDPWrap-v1.6.2.zip installation ZIP file to
C:\Program Files\RDPWrap in case you need to reinstall RDP Wrapper
