*** KioWare maintenance notes ***

There are three principal tasks involved with KioWare maintenance:

     * Updating the KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig configuration file to
       reflect new additions to the Access Control List (ACL)
     * Upgrading the KioWare software version; this is only occasionally
       done, usually annually
     * Reviewing the Windows Event Viewer logs to either troubleshoot
       problems or to derive user session activity statistics

Copying over the new KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig file can be done either
at the PAC, or remotely.  Upgrading the KioWare software has to be done at
the PAC.

(1) To update the KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig configuration file

To update the ACL list in the config file, (a) first, add new entries to the
ACL on your local development KioWare config file 
(KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig), then copy the revised config file to
each PAC, either (b) at the PAC or (c) remotely using the RDP client

a. To add new entries to the ACL

* To update the ACL, use the latest KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig file which
is the master file in the GitHub KioWare repository; copy the GitHub master
file of KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig to the directory path of
C:\ProgramData\KioWare Client on your local development unlicensed version of
KioWare; note: the unlicensed version of KioWare will occasionally display a
red nagware screen for 15 seconds indicating the KioWare software is unlicensed

* Note: the basic procedure is to have three applications open: a browser,
the KioWare Config Tool, and the KioWare application; one then toggles back
and forth between the three applications, identifying database links
that are not in the KioWare ACL, and then adding the appropriate domain
name URL to the ACL list; a useful technique is when in the KioWare
application in kiosk mode, to test several database links in one go
by clicking on several of them sequentially to open up several tabs,
and then looking at each tab to see which pages didn't render

* Then launch a browser such as Google Chrome

* Then launch the KioWare Config Tool, and navigate to the ACL list:
Security -> and then in the Access Lists pane, click on the "Browsing
Access" button; new entries are added by clicking on the New Domain
button; URLs can either be render in the default straight string "CONT"
mode, or clicking on "CONT" will change it to "REGX" so that you can
provide a regular expression pattern for the URL

* Then launch your unlicensed KioWare application, and step through the
A-Z list of databases in KioWare kiosk mode, identifying possible links
that are not in the ACL by pages that don't render

* For pages that don't load, toggle to a regular browser (e.g., Google Chrome)
and confirm the database website link is up and valid

* If the website is valid, then copy the website URL to the clipboard

* Then toggle back to the KioWare Configuration Tool to paste in and add
the missing website domain to the ACL list, making sure that the string is
only the domain (e.g., no "http://" or "https://" protocols, or directory
paths after the domain, etc.)

b. To copy the config file at the PAC

* Log out of kiosk mode
key combination: ****
password: **********

* You can now log in with your own username and password

* Copy your own modified configuration file and paste it in each of the four
public workstations in the following directory path: 
C:\ProgramData\KioWare Client\KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig

* Finally, reboot the PAC machine

* Note: if you ever need to log into the publicaccess account from the
login prompt, the username and password are the following:
username: **********
password: **********

c. To copy the config file remotely using the Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)
client

* To use the Remote Desktop Connection client
- In the search bar type "remote desktop connection"
- Click on "Remote Desktop Connection" to launch Remote Desktop
- Connect to one of the four public access workstations:
GM-M003994.ad.macewan.ca (3rd floor, east, Building 6)
GM-M003954.ad.macewan.ca (3rd floor, west, Building 7)
PAC-CC-003.ad.macewan.ca (2nd floor, left [south], Building 7)
PAC-CC-004.ad.macewan.ca (2nd floor, right [north], Building 7)

* Copy your own modified configuration file and paste it in each of the four
public workstations in the following directory path: 
C:\ProgramData\KioWare Client\KioWareClientSettings.kwconfig

* The PACs will automatically reboot early Monday morning; if no one is
at the PAC, you can reboot the machine remotely

Note: to remove entries from the Remote Desktop Connection Computer box in
the Windows Remote Desktop Connection client, start Registry Editor,
and then click the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default
Entries appear as MRUnumber, and are visible in the right pane. To
delete an entry, right-click it, and then click Delete

(2) To upgrade the KioWare software version
- At the PAC, exit kiosk mode
- Log into your own account
- Double click on the KioWareClientSetup.exe executable
- Don't need to configure anything, just step through dialog boxes
- Reboot the computer

(3) To review the Windows Event Viewer logs
- Log into the PAC either at the PAC or remotely
- Type "event viewer"
- In Event Viewer, double click on "Applications and Services Logs"
- Click on the "KW Platform" entry; entries are in reverse chronological order
- Click on the last date you want to copy, then scroll down to the first date
in the range you want to copy, hold the shift key down, then click on the
last date in the date range you want to copy
- Right click on the highlighted range
- Select Copy, and then "Copy Details as Text"
- Paste into a text editor and then save the file
- Parse and process the file to determine number of user sessions in a
particular time frame (e.g., per week, per month), the median time for a user
session, the longest session, the busiest week of the year, the busiest month
of the year, etc.
- Note: can copy processed user session frequency counts statistics for each
month for each PAC into a spreadsheet for a better visualization and
comparative purposes of the statistical data
